notes
+ demand for drugs is "price inelastic"
+ most people (all?) agree drugs are bad
+ making them illegal makes it even worse (more money in the hands of drug dealers)

+ incarceration rates
+ externalities

  - drug deals in bad neighborhoods lower the value of the houses in those neighborhoods
  - exacerbated by their illegality
